## Hot Key and TSS key-share Passwords

### Zetaclient
Previously there were two environment variables being used to store passwords encrypting the tss key file and local operator keyring file:

* HOTKEY_PASSWORD
* TSS_FRAGMENT_SEED

With this new change, these variables will no longer be valid.
Instead, a series of prompts will appear asking for passwords using STDIN during the startup process.

* Hot Key password
* TSS Key share password

If your key files are already encrypted, you can use the same passwords you provided in the environment variables.

**It's extremely important to take note of these passwords or commit them to memory.**

### Hot Key

#### File backend

* The hot key will use the existing keyring that holds your operator key. The file will be encrypted with your existing password,
make sure to use this same password when starting the client.

#### Test backend

* You will still be prompted for a password, but you need to leave it blank which indicates the test backend is being used. 

### TSS Key-Share

During key-gen, the password you enter will be used to encrypt the generated key-share file. The key data will be stored in
memory once the process is running. If the client needs to be restarted, this key-share file needs to be present on your
machine and will be decrypted using the password you've entered.
